## This is a learning project.
I am making this project to learn python.So, instead of learing the syntax first, I am building this project to learn while I am building this. I have made notes within the code as comments, of every new concept I get to know.

### About this project:
This is a 'guess the number' game. Here the user has to guess the number which the computer has selected within the range which the user has provided. Upon guessing the program also tells the number of attempts the user took to guess the number correct.
